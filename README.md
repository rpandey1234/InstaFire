# InstaFire

This project is a simple Android Instagram clone. It's powered by Firebase and written in Kotlin. Our app allows the user to sign in and create posts with an image and description. We use Firebase, an app development platform developed by Google, to power our application. We use various Firebase services such as Authentication, Storage, and Firestore.
